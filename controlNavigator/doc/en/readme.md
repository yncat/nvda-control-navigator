# cwToggler : character / word readout toggler  
## Overview  
git URL: https://github.com/yncat/cwToggler  
My website: https://www.nyanchangames.com/  
This add-on retrieves your "speak typed words" and "speak typed characters" settings and masks it when you're outside of any kind of editable text controls. You'll hear character / word echo only when you're actually editing texts. I'm sure gamers who like pressing space bar like the faimous keyboard crasher or non-gamers who use character-related shortcuts a lot really appreciate this(myself included of course).  
  
## Usage  
prebuilt package: https://www.nyanchangames.com/softs/count/download.php?download=9  
Or do `scons` to build for yourself  
Install and feel the usefulness.  
  
## TODO  
* Code optimization  
  
## Localizing  
Use the included cwToggler.pot. Make sure you save the file in UTF-8 without BOM.  
  
# Translating  
Run `scons pot`  
Edit the generated pot file (make sure you save the file in UTF-8 without BOM)  
Move and rename it as addon/locale/<YOUR_LANGUAGE_IDENTIFIER>/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po  
run `scons` to repackage
