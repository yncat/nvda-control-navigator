<h1>cwToggler : character / word readout toggler</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>git URL: https://github.com/yncat/cwToggler<br />
My website: https://www.nyanchangames.com/<br />
This add-on retrieves your "speak typed words" and "speak typed characters" settings and masks it when you're outside of any kind of editable text controls. You'll hear character / word echo only when you're actually editing texts. I'm sure gamers who like pressing space bar like the faimous keyboard crasher or non-gamers who use character-related shortcuts a lot really appreciate this(myself included of course).  </p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>prebuilt package: https://www.nyanchangames.com/softs/count/download.php?download=9<br />
Or do <code>scons</code> to build for yourself<br />
Install and feel the usefulness.  </p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code optimization  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Localizing</h2>
<p>Use the included cwToggler.pot. Make sure you save the file in UTF-8 without BOM.  </p>
<h1>Translating</h1>
<p>Run <code>scons pot</code><br />
Edit the generated pot file (make sure you save the file in UTF-8 without BOM)<br />
Move and rename it as addon/locale/<YOUR_LANGUAGE_IDENTIFIER>/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po<br />
run <code>scons</code> to repackage  </p>
